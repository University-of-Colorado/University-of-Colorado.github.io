## GitHub Accounts
### Do I have to use my personal GitHub account?
No, you can certainly create a new GitHub account if you like. However, there is also no harm in using your personal GitHub account.

### Can the University delete my GitHub account if it wants?
No, all the University is able to do is remove your association with the organization, we have no ability to delete a GitHub account.

### Can the University impersonate my GitHub user after I login?
No, this isn't possible.

### Can the University access my personal repositories?
No, the University will only know your github username, and of course any public repositories you have available will be visible as they always were.

## GitHub Quotas:
### Are there limitations on the size of my repository?
Please see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github).

### Can [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com) be used with GitHub?
Though you can technically use LFS with GitHub, our quota is so small (1GB) that it is not really useful. You can certainly use LFS if you host the files elsewhere, but hosting large files on GitHub is not really a possibility with the University's current plan.
