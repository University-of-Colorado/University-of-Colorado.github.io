While it depends on the use case, our GitHub Enterprise license is often better
suited for use by university administrative units than for teaching and
learning purposes.

Though there are a number of benefits included with our [Enterprise
plan][enterprise-plan], such as free GitHub Actions minutes for private
repositories, there are also limitations. For example, our license does not
include certain features like Codespaces (virtual developer environments),
GitHub Copilot (AI coding assistance), and GitHub Classroom.

Students and faculty, however, can [register directly with
GitHub][github-education-apply] and receive free access to these and other
tools for coding, teaching, and learning. To learn more, visit [Explore the
benefits of teaching and learning with GitHub
Education][github-education-benefits].

Note that our institution is not participating in the GitHub Campus Program.

## Codespaces and Copilot
Keep in mind that free, personal GitHub accounts can use Codespaces compute and
storage resources up to a certain amount without being charged. See GitHub's
[Codespaces pricing][codespaces-pricing] documentation for details.

For staff, we are currently unable to support Codespaces and Copilot
subscriptions managed and billed through our enterprise license. However,
individual GitHub users can upgrade to a paid plan (for Codespaces) and/or
[purchase Copilot as an individual][copilot-plans], and then use these features
when working on repositories within our enterprise.

Students and teachers who have registered with GitHub and individuals who have
paid for these features can use them when working on repositories within our
enterprise license.[^1] Of course, it's also fine to use these features in
personally-owned repositories or repositories that are part of an organization
outside our enterprise.

[^1]: This depends on organization settings.

## Questions?
The GitHub Enterprise license is shared among all the CU campuses and usage and
practices may differ.  Please reach out to your campus GitHub administrators or
organization owner with questions.

CU Boulder users can [create a support case for Platform
Engineering][ucb-support].
