While it depends on the use case, our GitHub Enterprise license is often better
suited for use by university administrative units than for teaching and
learning purposes.

Though there are a number of benefits included with our [Enterprise
plan][enterprise-plan], such as free GitHub Actions minutes for private
repositories, there are also limitations. For example, our license does not
include certain features like Codespaces (virtual developer environments),
GitHub Copilot (AI coding assistance), and GitHub Classroom.

Students and faculty, however, can [register directly with
GitHub][github-education-apply] and receive free access to these and other
tools for coding, teaching, and learning. To learn more, visit [Explore the
benefits of teaching and learning with GitHub
Education][github-education-benefits].

Note that our institution is not participating in the GitHub Campus Program.

## Codespaces and Copilot
Keep in mind that free, personal GitHub accounts can use Codespaces compute and
storage resources up to a certain amount without being charged. See GitHub's
[Codespaces pricing][codespaces-pricing] documentation for details.

For staff, we are currently unable to support Codespaces and Copilot
subscriptions managed and billed through our enterprise license. However,
individual GitHub users can upgrade to a paid plan (for Codespaces) and/or
[purchase Copilot as an individual][copilot-plans], and then use these features
when working on repositories within our enterprise.

In general, students and teachers who have registered with GitHub and
individuals who have paid for these features can use them when working on
repositories within our enterprise license. However, this may depend on
organization settings - see the [Questions](#questions) section below if you
are unsure about this.

Of course, it's also fine to use these features in personally-owned
repositories or repositories that are part of an organization outside our
enterprise.

### Caution

As an artificial intelligence (AI) tool, caution is required when using
GitHub Copilot - careful steps may need to be taken to ensure that you
understand how it integrates with your environment, makes coding suggestions,
and whether content from your repository may be automatically shared with
GitHub. This can be complicated.

See the following GitHub documentation pages for additional details:

  - [Configuring GitHub Copilot in your environment][configure-environment-copilot]
  - [Excluding content from GitHub Copilot][excluding-content-copilot]

Also, please refer to the CU System [Guidance for Artificial Intelligence
Tools Use][cu-ai-guidance] web page and additional AI guidance and security
resources for your specific CU campus.

## Questions?
The GitHub Enterprise license is shared among all the CU campuses. Please reach
out to your campus GitHub administrators with questions.

CU Boulder users can [create a support case for the OIT Platform Engineering
team][ucb-support].
