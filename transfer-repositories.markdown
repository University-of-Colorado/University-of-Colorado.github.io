As Github is being set up for all campuses existing Github organizations are being transferred into the enterprise. For simplicity of management we are trying to maintain a single organization per campus. As such users will need to transfer repositories from one organization to another. Thankfully this is a simple process.

1. You will need to have signed in to your existing campus' organization.
1. It is recommended that you [create a team](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/creating-a-team) in the new organization assuming you are collaborating with others. If the repository will be for your use only, there is no need to create a team.
1. Follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/transferring-a-repository#transferring-a-repository-owned-by-your-organization) to transfer the repository to the organization.
