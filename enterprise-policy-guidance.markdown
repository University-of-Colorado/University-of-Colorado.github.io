This document aims to contain guidance for setting policy at the enterprise level.

### In a phrase... you probably shouldn't
In the future this may change but at this point in order for campuses to remain as autonomous as possible there is no policies set at the enterprise level. If you absolutly feel you must set something at the enterprise level, please ensure you have spoken with all other enterprise administrators about the change and consensus has been reached.
